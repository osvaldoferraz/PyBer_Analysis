# PyBer Ride-Sharing
## Analysis Overview
The analysis scope is to look at PyBer Ride Sharing drivers data in urban, suburban and rural cities, compare these settings and give information and suggestions to management regarding how these diferences can be used to improve decision-making.

## Results
Tha data analysed was from early Jan, 2019 to early May, 2019 and produced the numbers/graph below:

As can be seen on the summary/graph above:
- *Total rides* vary significantly according to the city type. **Suburban** rides are **5x higher** than Rural rides, and **Urban** rides are **2.6x higher** than Suburban ones.  
- The numbers of *total drivers* also vary  a lot according to the city type. **Suburban** drivers are **6.3x higher** than theur Rural peers, and **Urban** drivers are **4.9x higher** than Suburban drivers.
- As excpected, the *total fares* chargerd in this period followerd the same pattern: **Suburban total fares** are **4.5x higher** than ther Rural total fares, and **Urban total fares** are **2x higher** than Suburban total fares.
- *Averages per ride* are smaller in the **Urban** cities, followed by **Suburban** cities, with Rural cities leading in price, being **11% higher** than Suburban, and **Suburban** being **26% higher** than Urban fare per ride.
- Following the Average Fare per Ride trend, the *Average Fare per Driver* in the **Rural** setting is **40% higher** than in **Suburban** cities, and this one is **38% higher** than the **Urban** Average Fare per Driver

## Summary
The diferences on the Rural setting are the biggest ones, and some things could be addresesd to increase PyBer users in this type of city. First thing would be addressing the Fare - the average fare is too high when compared to the Urban/Suburban ones. This would make the ride more accessible. Together with this change, the number of drivers has also to increase, and that would reflect in the number of rides, increasing the company's revenue. Finally, these same changes can be applied to the Suburban setting in a smaller ratio - making it more similar to the Urban enviroment. If the average fare decreases, the use of the ride-sharing will go up, thus increasing the company's access and revenue.
